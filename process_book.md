## Overview and Motivation

The **Song Sonics & Feelings** web application was constructed to examine the relationship between song sonics and the mapping of feelings to parametric neurophysiological foundations.

The motivation to develop **Song Sonics & Feelings** was to understand the connection between the sonic qualities of songs and the resulting primary feeling of respondents. Through processing sonic features and mathematically clustering songs within a neurophysiological framework, a *PCA* instance illustrates the level of consistency in which linear combinations of sonic values accurately predict the resulting primary feeling of respondents.

## Related Work

1. **Music Information Retrieval (MIR):** Implementing computational analysis to extract meaningful features from audio signals such as tempo, loudness, and spectral complexity.
2. **Russell's Core Affect Framework (2003):** A highly influential framework that maps feelings to one of four quadrants along two neurophysiological dimensions:
   * **Valence:** The horizontal axis representing the physiological level of positivity (pleasantness) or negativity (unpleasantness).
   * **Arousal:** The vertical axis representing the physiological level of energy, which ranges from low (sleepy/deactivated) to high (excited/activated).

## Research Questions

* How do scalar sonic features such as `bpm`, `danceability`, and `onset_rate` cluster songs together in a *PCA*?
* To what extent do linear combinations of song sonics accurately predict the classification of the respondent's primary feeling through *Russell's Core Affect Framework*?
* Why do some songs such as *My Sacrifice* by *Creed* mathematically cluster in one quadrant according to *PCA* coordinates, yet evoke primary feelings mapping to a different quadrant through *Russell's Core Affect Framework*?

## Data Collection, Cleaning, and Processing Summary

As detailed in *data_methodology_log.md*, the Song Preference & Feeling Survey was administered to a targeted 250 full-time employees in the United States through SurveyMonkey from May 28th, 2026 to June 5th, 2026. A total of 275 survey responses from full-time employees were collected and stored in `survey_data_master_raw.csv`.

Since `survey_data_master_raw.csv` is a small dataset and contains open-response survey data that represents human thought and writing, steps are manually executed and executed through Python programs to build the succeeding CSV files:

- **V1:** `[Initial Quality Sweep, Manual Context Review, Establish structural base]` $\rightarrow$ `survey_data_master_structural_base.csv`
- **V2:** `[Dataset Truncation (Simple Random Sampling), Python Program Execution, Select representative subset of dataset]` $\rightarrow$ `survey_data_master_sampled.csv`
- **V3:** `[Complete Quality Sweep and Song URL Insertion, Manual Context Review, Remove invalid data and systematically correct information]` $\rightarrow$ `survey_data_master_corrected.csv`
- **V4:** `[Primary Feeling Mapping, Python Program Execution, Map each remaining primary feeling in the [primary_feeling] column to one of the four quadrants established in Russell's Core Affect Framework]` $\rightarrow$ `survey_data_master_primary_feelings_mapped.csv`
- **V5:** `[Song Downloading and WAV Conversion, Python Program Execution, Download each song in the [song_name] column through the corresponding URL in the [youtube_music_url] column and convert to WAV]` $\rightarrow$ `survey_data_master_song_download.csv`
- **V6:** `[Essentia Sonic Feature Extraction, Python Program Execution, Calculate and record 12 sonic scalar values for each of the 45 remaining data rows through accessing the WAV file referenced in the [wav_filename] column]` $\rightarrow$ `survey_data_master_sonic_feature_calculations.csv`
- **V7:** `[Sonic Feature Scalar Standardization, Python Program Execution, Standardize the 12 sonic scalar values for each of the 45 remaining data rows]` $\rightarrow$ `survey_data_master_sonic_feature_standardization.csv`
- **V8:** `[PCA Dimensionality Reduction, Python Program Execution, Compress 12 multi-dimensional standardized sonic features into 2 static spatial dimensions (pca_x and pca_y) for PCA rendering]` $\rightarrow$ `pca_matrix.json`

## Design Evolution

The core visual tool is the **Exploratory PCA Scatter Plot**. 

* **Early Concept:** The initial design aimed to plot raw sonic features against one another, which quickly became cluttered due to the high dimensionality (12 distinct features).
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Implementing **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** allowed us to reduce those 12 dimensions down to 2 main coordinates ($PC1$ and $PC2$) while retaining the maximum variance in the data.
* **Integrating Psychology:** To make the math intuitive, $PC1$ was mapped to represent the horizontal axis of **Valence** (negative feelings on the left, positive on the right), and $PC2$ was mapped to represent the vertical axis of **Arousal** (low energy at the bottom, high energy at the top).
* **Color-Coding:** Data points are color-coded into four distinct quadrants based on Russell’s Core Affect Framework:
  * 🟨 **Quadrant 1:** High Arousal + Positive Valence
  * 🟥 **Quadrant 2:** High Arousal + Negative Valence
  * 🟦 **Quadrant 3:** Low Arousal + Negative Valence
  * 🟩 **Quadrant 4:** Low Arousal + Positive Valence

## Implementation

The application is built as a highly interactive, responsive web experience deployed on Vercel. 
* **Frontend:** Interactive scatter plot utilizing modern web standards.
* **Interactivity:** A comprehensive, hover-enabled tooltip allows users to explore individual data points, revealing detailed sonic attributes, coordinates, and song metadata.
* **Math Layer:** The alignment of Principal Components to the coordinate plane allows a direct spatial overlay of mathematical song similarities on top of emotional quadrants.

## Analysis and Findings

The exploratory visualizer successfully demonstrates that songs with similar sonic properties group together. However, a fascinating cognitive gap was identified:

> **The Sonic vs. Emotional Disconnect**
> A subset of songs is associated with a Primary Feeling mapping to a Core Affect Quadrant that differs from its mathematical spatial cluster in the Exploratory PCA. 
> 
> *Example:* **My Sacrifice** by Creed is emotionally associated with **Core Affect Quadrant 1** (High Arousal + Positive Valence), yet its mathematical sonic profile causes it to cluster in **Quadrant 3** (Low Arousal + Negative Valence). 

This highlights that human emotional response to music is not purely a product of raw physical sonics; lyricism, nostalgia, cultural context, and personal memory play massive roles in how we process a song's "feeling."

## Limitations

* **Sample Size & Diversity:** The current dataset represents a curated subset of songs and user responses.
* **Linear Assumptions:** PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique; it may miss complex, non-linear relationships between certain sonic elements.
* **Subjectivity of Feelings:** Emotional mapping relies on self-reported "Primary Feelings" which vary heavily across different respondent demographics.

## Future Work

* **Expanding the Dataset:** Incorporating a broader catalog of genres, tempos, and global music styles.
* **Non-linear Embeddings:** Experimenting with t-SNE or UMAP to see if non-linear dimensionality reduction yields more emotionally cohesive spatial clusters.
* **Interactive Surveying:** Allowing live users to input their own emotional responses to songs and dynamically updating the database to see how emotional consensus shifts.
